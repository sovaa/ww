# Wizard and Warrior #

## About ##

A text-based detective adventure game. 

Everything is very much a prototype right now, with a lot of loosely connected features not yet evaluated if they should be in the game or not. It's currently playable, and a few quests can be done. Expect bugs and weird behaviors.

## Install ##

A simple `make jar` in the root directory should, if you're lucky, compile `ww` and create a `.jar` file in the `target` directory which you should be able to run using the following command:

`java -jar target/ww.jar`
